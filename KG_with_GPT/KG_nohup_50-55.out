PUZZLE: A man is lying dead in a room.  There is a large pile of gold and jewels on the floor, a chandelier attached to the ceiling, and a large open window. What happened?
* Was the man killed by the chandelier?
/data/yangyueting/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/transformers/models/t5/tokenization_t5_fast.py:166: FutureWarning: This tokenizer was incorrectly instantiated with a model max length of 512 which will be corrected in Transformers v5.
For now, this behavior is kept to avoid breaking backwards compatibility when padding/encoding with `truncation is True`.
- Be aware that you SHOULD NOT rely on t5-base automatically truncating your input to 512 when padding/encoding.
- If you want to encode/pad to sequences longer than 512 you can either instantiate this tokenizer with `model_max_length` or pass `max_length` when encoding/padding.
- To avoid this warning, please instantiate this tokenizer with `model_max_length` set to your preferred value.
