The man was in a ship that was wrecked on a desert island. When there was no food left, another passenger brought what he said was abalone but was really part of the man's wife (who had died in the wreck). The man suspects something fishy, so when they finally return to civilization, he orders abalone, realizes that what he ate before was his wife, and kills himself.
the man was in a lifeboat, with his wife, who died.  He hallucinated an albatross landing in the boat which he caught and killed and ate; he thought that his wife had been washed overboard.  When he actually eats albatross, he discovers that he had actually eaten his wife.
The man had  previously eaten human flesh under the name "albatross".  He thinks that "albatross soup" means "human soup" so he kills himself.

Emily is a child; she can only reach the tenth-floor button, and last year she could only reach the ninth-floor button.
The man is a travel agent.  He had sold someone two tickets for an ocean voyage, one round-trip and one one-way.  The last name of the man who bought the tickets is the same as the last name of the woman who "fell" overboard and drowned on the same voyage, which is the subject of the article he's reading.
A physics professor is demonstrating conservation of energy by suspending a bowling ball from a piece of rope.  He pulls the ball back until it's right in front of his nose, then lets go.  It is supposed to swing away from him, then back at him, stopping just in front of his nose. Unfortunately, he gave the ball a slight push, resulting in the ball crashing into his nose upon its return.
The drinks contain poisoned ice cubes; one man drinks slowly, giving them time to melt, while the other drinks quickly and thus doesn't get much of the poison.
The man has hiccups; the bartender scares them away by pulling a gun.
Both women are white; the one whose house this takes place in is single.  A black friend of the other woman, the one who goes into the bathroom, was recently killed, reportedly by the KKK.  The woman who goes into the bathroom discovers a bloodstained KKK robe in the other's laundry hamper, picks up a nail file from the medicine cabinet (or some other impromptu weapon), and goes out and kills the other.

The hot sun reflected from the woman's large mirror and heated the lingerie she was wearing to the burning point.  She was absorbed in a book at the time and didn't notice the heat until her clothing was afire. Nobody could get to her to help because her doors were locked from the inside.
The man was lost in the desert for days.  He couldn't find any landmarks, so he started sticking slips of paper to cactuses he passed. After another day of walking, with almost no water left, he came across this cactus, which had a slip of paper on it already; he knew that he was walking in circles, so rather than wait to die of thirst he shot himself.
You're a diver, going past a window of a sunken submarine (or ship).  The two men were in a sinking vessel; they had a gun but only one bullet.  Neither wanted to drown, so they played cards to see who would get the bullet.  The loser shot the winner (or else the winner shot himself), and then the loser drowned when the room filled up with water.
They're the remains of a melted snowman.
Because there was a heavy fog, two people driving in opposite directions on the same road both stuck their heads out of their windows to better see the road's center line.  Their heads hit each other at high speed, killing them both.
The car is a convertible; the top was down.  (Or the sunroof, or something else that's neither window nor door.)  The murderer shot him and then dropped the gun into the back seat of the car.
The man is allergic to cats, and feels the allergy symptoms coming on, so he knows the box contains a cat.
A mosquito bit me, and I swatted it when it later landed on my ceiling (so the blood is my own as well as the mosquito's).
He is a guard/attendant in a leper colony.  The letter (to him) tells him that he has contracted the disease.  The key is the cigarette burning down between his fingers -- leprosy is fairly unique in killing off sensory nerves without destroying motor ability.
She opens the door and sees that the handle of her cup is facing the back of the microwave.  She then sets the oven for two more seconds so that the turntable will turn 180 degrees so that she can reach the cup-handle, to avoid burning her hand.
The man is a beekeeper, and the bees attack en masse because they don't recognize his fragrance.  Randy adds that this is based on something that actually happened to his grandfather, a beekeeper who was severely attacked by his bees when he used a new aftershave for the first time in 10 or 20 years.
He's a smuggler.  On the first cruise, someone brings the contraband to his cabin, and he hides it in an air conditioning duct. Returning to the U.S., he leaves without the contraband, and so passes through customs with no trouble.  On the second trip, he has the same cabin on the same ship.  Because it doesn't stop anywhere, he doesn't have to go through customs when he returns, so he gets the contraband off safely.
He was with several others in a hot air balloon crossing the desert.  The balloon was punctured and they began to lose altitude.  They tossed all their non-essentials overboard, then their clothing and food, but were still going to crash in the middle of the desert.  Finally, they drew matches to see who would jump over the side and save the others; this man lost.  Minor variant wording: add that the man is nude.
He jumped out of an airplane, but his parachute failed to open.
He pulled his shoelace instead of the ripcord.
Same as #1.25.
He jumped out of an airplane but his parachute failed to open.
Let's say "she" is named Suzy, and "they" are named Harry and Jane.  Harry is an elderly archaeologist who has found a very old skeleton, which he's dubbed "Jane" (a la "Lucy").  Suzy is a buyer for a museum; she's supposed to make some sort of purchase from Harry, so she invites him to have a business dinner with her (at a restaurant).  When she calls to invite him, he keeps talking about "Jane," so Suzy assumes that Jane is his wife and says to bring her along.  Harry, offended, calls Suzy's boss and complains; since Suzy should've known who Jane was, she gets fired.
The man was the night watchman; he should've been on duty the previous night, not dreaming.  (He tells the boss about the dream out of concern for his safety.)
There is a poisonous spider in the toe of his shoe.  The last things he puts on are his shoes.  He gets bitten, feels ill, lies down on his bed, and then dies of the poison.  (It's a particularly poisonous spider, like the Australian Funnel-Web, whose bite can kill an adult human in 5 minutes, or the brown recluse, which I gather is also pretty deadly.)
The man is drinking diet shakes for his breakfast and lunch in order to lose weight.  Unfortunately, his first job is at a weight-loss clinic, so he is fired for patronizing the competition.  His second job is at a health-food store, and his boss wants him to lose weight so he looks "healthier."
The murderer sets the car on a slope above the hot dog stand where the victim works.  He then wedges an ice block in the car to keep the brake pedal down, and puts the car in neutral, after which he flies to another city to avoid suspicion.  It's a warm day; when the ice melts, the car rolls down the hill and strikes the hot dog man at his roadside stand, killing him.
He's leaving a hospital after visiting his wife, who's on heavy life-support.  When the power goes out, he knows she can't live without the life-support systems (he assumes that if the emergency backup generator were working, the elevator wouldn't lose power; this aspect isn't entirely satisfactory, so in a variant, the scene is at home rather than in a hospital).
The woman is confined in an iron lung, and the music is playing on her radio or stereo.  The power goes out.

There is a safe full of jewelry on the train. The victim, Schmidt, is the conductor who guards the cargo; He robbed the safe and made an accomplice travel on the train under a false name in order to remove the loot. Accomplice kill Schmidt to keep his share. Schmidt did not know the pseudonym of his accomplice, so he wrote down the murderer's berth number, 11. For clarity, he spelled the number into one word in his native German language.

The two men were working in a small room protected by a carbon dioxide gas fire extinguisher system, when a fire broke out in an adjoining room.  One of the men ran through the fire and escaped with only minor burns.  The other one stayed in the room until the fire extinguishers kicked in, and died of oxygen starvation.
The fire is slow moving and the four are able to "back burn" by  starting a new fire on the other side of them. When an area is burnt off, they can safely stand on the burnt patch, as it now contains no fuel for the grass fire.

The man was blind. Elevators use buttons that work electrically through the skin. The button is activated at the slightest touch, making the elevator to run. He got into the elevator on his first day, wearing gloves. Therefore, men must remove gloves to make the buttons work. But on the first day he found that when he found the tenth floor with his ungloved hand stroking the buttons, all the buttons were activated and the elevator stopped on all floors. So since then, he has carried gloves with him. When he entered the elevator, he put it on, found the right button with his gloved hand, and pressed the button on the tenth floor with his ungloved hand.

A large man comes home to the penthouse apartment he shares with his beautiful young wife, taking the elevator up from the ground floor. He sees signs of lovemaking in the bedroom, and assumes that his wife is having an affair; her beau has presumably escaped down the stairs.  The husband looks out the French windows and sees a good-looking man just leaving the main entrance of the building.  The husband pushes the refrigerator out through the window onto the young man below.  The husband dies of a heart attack from overexertion; the innocent young man below dies from having a refrigerator fall on him; and the wife's boyfriend, who was hiding inside the refrigerator, also dies from the fall.
A young boy is going out to play one afternoon and on his way out he stops off in the garage to check for an ice cream bar in the large chest freezer the family keeps there.  The freezer is new and almost empty as yet, so the boy has to prop himself up on the edge to reach into the bottom to find the ice cream.  He loses his balance and falls into the freezer, with the lid latching shut over him.  Right about then, his older brother arrives home from high school and asks his mom if they have any popsicles in the freezer.  She says no, but she bought some chocolate ice cream that day and he can have some of that if he wishes.  He decides he is not in the mood for chocolate ice cream and goes up to his room to listen to some music.  His brother suffocates.
It's the man's fiftieth birthday, and in celebration of this he plans to kill his wife, then take the money he's embezzled and move on to a new life in another state.

He opens the door, dragging her body in with him, and all the lights suddenly turn on and a group of his friends shout "Surprise!"  He kills himself.
A man was shot during a robbery in his store one night.  He staggered into the back room, where the telephone was, and called home, dialing by feel since he hadn't turned on the light.  Once the call went through he gasped, "I'm at the store.  I've been shot.  Help!" or words to that effect.  He set the phone down to await help, but none came; he'd treated the telephone pushbuttons like cash register numbers, when the arrangements of the numbers are upside down reflections of each other.  The stranger he'd dialed had no way to know where "the store" was.
The dead man was playing Santa Claus, for whatever reason; he slipped while coming down the chimney and broke his neck.
The man was a famous artist.  A woman who collected autographs saw him dining; after he left the restaurant, she purchased the check that he used to pay for the meal from the restaurant manager.  The check was therefore never cashed, so the artist never paid for the meal.
The sailor grabbed the fire hose from the deck and used the force of the water from the hose to push the mine away from the hull of the ship.  The water pressure doesn't explode the mine; WWII-style mines contain magnetic sensors which make them explode on contact with a ship's hull.
It's the middle of the night.  The man goes outside to get something from his car, but as the parking lot is set apart from the building, he forgets which room he was in.  His wife is deaf, so he honks the car horn loudly, waking up everyone else in the motel.  The other residents all get up and turn on their room lights; the man then returns to the one dark room.
There's a car wash on that corner.  On rainy days, the rain reduces traction.  On sunny days, water from the car wash has the same effect.  If rain is threatening, though, the car wash gets little business and thus doesn't make the road wet, so I can take the corner faster.
The man opens his mouth; some killer bees (which tend to prefer attacking darker areas) fly inside and sting him; the swelling of his throat asphyxiates him.
The movie is at a drive-in theatre.
The woman is a tightrope walker in a circus.  Her act consists of walking the rope blindfolded, accompanied by music, without a net.  The musician (organist, or calliopist, or pianist, or whatever) is supposed to stop playing when she reaches the end of the rope, telling her that it's safe to step off onto the platform.  For unknown reasons (but with murderous intent), he stops the music early, and she steps off the rope to her death.
The woman is a trapeze artist who times her act (from starting time to time to jump for another trapeze) by the music.  The organist changes tempo or stops the music too soon, and the trapeze artist falls to her death.
Charlie was an insect sitting on a chair; the music playing was for the game Musical Chairs.
Abel is a prince of the island nation that he landed on.  A cruel and warlike prince, he waged many land and naval battles along with his father the king.  In one naval encounter, their ship sank, the king died, and the prince swam to a deserted island where he spent several months building a raft or small boat.  In the meantime, a regent was appointed to the island nation, and he brought peace and prosperity.  When Prince Abel returned to his kingdom, Cain (a native fisherman) realized that the peace of the land would only be maintained if Abel did not reascend to his throne, and killed the prince (with a piece of driftwood or some other impromptu weapon).
Several men were shipwrecked together.  They agreed to survive by eating each other a piece at a time.  Each of them in turn gave up an arm, but before they got to the last man, they were rescued.  They all demanded that the last man live up to his end of the deal.  Instead, he killed a bum and sent the bum's arm to the others in a box to "prove" that he had fulfilled the bargain.  Later, one of them sees him on the subway, holding onto an overhead ring with the arm he supposedly cut off; the other realizes that the last man cheated, and kills him.

The sole survivor of a shipwreck reached a desert isle. Unfortunately, he was blind.  Luckily, there was a freshwater spring on the island, and he rigged the ship's bell (which had drifted to the island also) at the spring's location.  The bell rang in the wind, directing him to water.  When he was becalmed for a week, he could not find water again, and so he died of thirst.
A blind swimmer kept a portable transistor radio on the beach to tell him when and what direction to go to shore.  when the batteries gave out  he got lost and drowned.
This allows red herrings involving the homonyms "boy" and "buoy" (in some pronunciations).  Only use this wording if you want to intentionally confuse your audience.

Hans and Fritz do everything right up until they're filling out a personal-information form and have to write down their birthdays. Fritz' birthday is, say, July 7, so he writes down 7/7/15.  Hans, however, was born on, say, June 20, so he writes down 20/6/18 instead of what an American would write, 6/20/18.  Note that this is only a problem because they *claim* to be returning Americans; there are lots of other nations which use the same date ordering.

The man used to be blind; he's now returning from an eye operation which restored his sight.  He's spent all his money on the operation, so when the train (which has no internal lighting) goes through a tunnel he at first thinks he's gone blind again and almost decides to kill himself.

The native chief asked him, "What is the third baseman's name in the Abbot and Costello routine 'Who's on First'?"  The man, who had no idea, said "I don't know," the correct answer.  However, he was a major smartass, so if he had known the answer he would have pointed out that What was the *second* baseman's name.  The chief, being quite humorless, would have executed him on the spot.
