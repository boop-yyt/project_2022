Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like the solution to the puzzle involves cutting a cake into pieces and allowing people to choose their own pieces. If the system is fair, then this means that no one can complain about receiving too large or too small a piece, and that each person is able to choose their own piece. One way that the jealous wife might have been able to read the letter without breaking the seal or tearing the envelope would be to carefully cut a small sliver off the edge of the envelope, being careful not to break the seal or tear the envelope. Then, she could slide the letter out of the envelope, read it, and slide it back in without her husband noticing. Alternatively, she might have been able to read the letter by using a tool such as a letter opener or a thin blade to carefully slice open the envelope along the seam, being careful not to break the seal or tear the envelope. Once the envelope was opened, she could read the letter and then use tape or glue to seal the envelope back up again, so that it would appear as though it had not been opened. I hope this helps to solve the puzzle! Let me know if you have any other questions. 
It's not clear from the information provided why a significant number of people would have a Crucifixion scene tattooed on their bodies if they did not share any particular religious beliefs. There could be a variety of reasons why someone might choose to get a tattoo of a Crucifixion scene, even if they are not particularly religious.

Others might simply appreciate the artistry of tattoo designs and choose to get a tattoo for aesthetic reasons. Without more information about the context in which these tattoos are being chosen and the motivations of the people getting them, it's difficult to say why a significant number of people might have a Crucifixion scene tattooed on their bodies. 
There could be a variety of reasons why the assistant in the luggage shop might have suggested that Pat rent a suitcase instead of buying one. Some possible explanations could include: The shop only rents out suitcases and does not sell them. The shop specializes in providing luggage for short-term use, such as for travelers who are only in town for a brief period of time. The shop might have a policy of encouraging customers to rent rather than buy suitcases in order to reduce waste and promote sustainability. The shop might have a limited selection of suitcases for sale and believe that renting would be a more convenient or cost-effective option for the customer. Without more information about the shop and its policies, it's difficult to say exactly why the assistant might have suggested that Pat rent a suitcase instead of buying one. 
In a knockout tennis tournament, the number of matches that must be played to determine an overall winner is equal to the number of participants in the tournament minus one. In this case, with 213 people entering the tournament, the least number of matches that must be played to decide an overall winner is 212. This is because each match involves two players, and the winner of each match advances to the next round while the loser is eliminated. In order to determine an overall winner, all of the participants must be eliminated except for one, who will be crowned the champion. Therefore, the number of matches that must be played is equal to the number of participants minus one. I hope this helps to solve the puzzle! Let me know if you have any other questions. 
Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like Harry was working in his garage and made something that was able to travel at a speed of over 3000 miles per hour (4800 kilometers per hour) in order to protect the safety of himself or his wife.
