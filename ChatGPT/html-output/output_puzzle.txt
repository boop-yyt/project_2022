The man who was cycling traveled 12 miles per hour for 1 hour, a total of 12 miles. They both then ran for 15 minutes at 8 miles per hour, a total of 2 miles each. In total, the man who was walking traveled a distance of 4 + 2 = 6 miles, and the man who was cycling traveled a distance of 12 + 2 = 14 miles.
