When there was no food left, another passenger brought what he said was abalone but was really part of the man's wife (who had died in the wreck). The man suspects something fishy, so when they finally return to civilization, he orders abalone, realizes that what he ate before was his wife, and kills himself.  (In a slight variant, from _Stories With Holes_, he simply faints rather than killing himself.)"

He hallucinated an albatross landing in the boat which he caught and killed and ate; he thought that his wife had been washed overboard.  When he actually eats albatross, he discovers that he had actually eaten his wife."
