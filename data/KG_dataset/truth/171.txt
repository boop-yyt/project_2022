This is a post-holocaust scenario of some kind; for whatever reason, the man believes himself to be the last human on earth.  He doesn't want to live by himself, so he jumps, just before the telephone rings... (of course, it could be a computer calling, but he has no way of knowing).A real-world version (with less plausible motivation) has the man being "lonely and despondent" and hoping for phone calls but not receiving any; he finally jumps out the window in despair.
