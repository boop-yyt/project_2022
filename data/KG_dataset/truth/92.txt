The solution is essentially the same, except (a) the topic of the lunch discussion was specifically whether someone can be hyponotised to do something they normally would not do, (b) there's no mention in the teaser of the heart attack, and (c) the men are long-time friends.  Also, the hypnotist is a doctor, so he's sure the heart attack will be fatal.  The shooting is non-fatal and is intended to "wake up" the hypnotized friend to keep him from killing his wife.
