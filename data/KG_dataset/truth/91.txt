Mr. H and his new wife are in the hotel for their honeymoon. Mrs. H is upstairs in their suite; Mr. H has stopped for a drink.  In the bar he strikes up a conversation with a complete stranger, Mr. X, who turns out to be a hypnotist.  Mr. H claims he can't be hypnotized; a heated discussion ensues, after which Mr. X hypnotizes Mr. H, telling Mr. H to kill his wife.  (Mr. X intends to stop Mr. H before he actually commits the crime.)  They head for the honeymoon suite, but partway up the stairs Mr. X has a heart attack; he punches Mr. H in an attempt to end the trance before Mr. X dies. (JKM original?)
