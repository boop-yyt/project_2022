The shopkeeper is a French baker.  An American tourist walks into the bakery, pauses to look up/remember the word for "bread" in French, which is spelled "pain."  The American says the word as if it were the English word "pain."  At first the shopkeeper does not understand what the American is saying.  When he does, he gets annoyed with the person's horrible pronunciation.  (He then becomes happy after realizing that he can charge whatever exorbitant amount he wishes because the American doesn't know any better.)  I may eventually make this one the main entry and #2.22 the variant, since this version works better aloud.
