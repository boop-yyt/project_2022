Attached to the train was a caboose with a safe carrying a shipment of jewels.  The victim, Schmidt, was the conductor guarding the shipment; he had robbed the safe himself, and had an accomplice traveling on the train under a false name to remove the loot.  The accomplice killed Schmidt to keep his share.  Schmidt didn't know the accomplice's false name, so he wrote the killer's berth number, 11.  For greater clarity he spelled out the number as a word -- in his native German.  (In the original story he didn't want "11" to be misread as two parallel lines, but Germans don't write "1" as a straight line.) This arguably belongs in section 2 for double meaning, but the double-meaninged word here is explicitly called out, so I'm going to leave it in section 1 for now.
