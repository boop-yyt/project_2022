The woman is a tightrope walker in a circus.  Her act consists of walking the rope blindfolded, accompanied by music, without a net.  The musician (organist, or calliopist, or pianist, or whatever) is supposed to stop playing when she reaches the end of the rope, telling her that it's safe to step off onto the platform.  For unknown reasons (but with murderous intent), he stops the music early, and she steps off the rope to her death.The woman is a character in an opera, who "dies" at the end of her song.The "woman" is the dancing figure atop a music box, who "dies" when the box runs down.  (Both of the above variants would probably require placing this puzzle in section 2 of the list.)  (See also #1.31a, #1.70a, and #1.75c.)
