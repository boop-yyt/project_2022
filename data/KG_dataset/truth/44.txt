The two men were working in a small room protected by a carbon dioxide gas fire extinguisher system, when a fire broke out in an adjoining room.  One of the men ran through the fire and escaped with only minor burns.  The other one stayed in the room until the fire extinguishers kicked in, and died of oxygen starvation.  (This originally involved a halon gas extinguisher, but those don't work that way; fortunately for our purposes, Gisle Hannemyr pointed out that CO2 extinguishers do work that way.  Gisle says a CO2 extinguisher on a Norwegian ship a few years ago did go off accidentally when there was no fire, killing everyone in the engine room.)
