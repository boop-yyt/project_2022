Someone saw the guy conceal a card, and proved the deck was defective by turning it up and pointing out the missing ace.  Or, the game was bridge, and the others noticed the cheating when the deal didn't come out even.  The man had palmed an ace during the shuffle and meant to put it in his own hand during the deal, but muffed it.  (both answers from Mark Brader)
