He is in a hotel, and is unable to sleep because the man in the adjacent room is snoring.  He calls the room next door (from his own room number he can easily figure out his neighbor's, and from the room number, the telephone number).  The snorer wakes up, answers the phone.  The first man hangs up without saying anything and goes to sleep before the snorer gets back to sleep and starts snoring again.(slight) It's a next-door neighbor in an apartment building who's snoring, rather than in a hotel.  The caller thus knows his neighbor and the phone number.
