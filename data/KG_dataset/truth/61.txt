A poor peasant from somewhere in Europe wants desperately to get to the U.S.  Not having money for airfare, he stows away in the landing gear compartment of a jet.  He dies of hypothermia in mid-flight, and falls out when the landing gear compartment opens as the plane makes its final approach.  This apparently happened in real life as well; Mark Brader provided an AP item from Paris, printed in the _Toronto Star_ on 7/10/93, about just such an occurrence.
