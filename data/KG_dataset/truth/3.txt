The man already knew that he had eaten human flesh under the name "albatross."  He asks the waiter in the restaurant what kind of soup is available, and the waiter responds, "Albatross soup."  Thinking that "albatross soup" means "human soup," and sickened by the thought of such a society (place in a foreign country if necessary), he kills himself.    I'm afraid this version doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
