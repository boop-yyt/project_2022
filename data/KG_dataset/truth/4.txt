The man is a midget.  He can't reach the upper elevator buttons, but he can ask people to push them for him.  He can also push them with his umbrella.  I've usually heard this stated with more details: "Every morning he wakes up, gets dressed, eats, goes to the elevator..."  In the other direction, for a shorter problem statement, leave out the "someone else in the elevator" and "if it was raining" parts, and just say on his return to the building he always goes to the tenth floor.  Ron Carter suggests a nice red herring: the man lives on the 13th floor of the building.
