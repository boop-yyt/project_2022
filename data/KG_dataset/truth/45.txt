The fire is slow moving and the four are able to "back burn" by  starting a new fire on the other side of them. When an area is burnt off, they can safely stand on the burnt patch, as it now contains no fuel for the grass fire. This is an actual technique used in Australian bushfires (and, I think, elsewhere).
