The chap shaking his foot to dislodge the stone was leanig against a metal light pole.  The other fellow came along and thought that the pole had become 'live' somehow; he thought the first fellow was being electrocuted (and that the muscles in his hand had contracted and he couldn't let go).  So the second fellow rushed over and whacked the first one on the arm, hard.  He apologised for it afterwards.  (A true story, from an Australian newspaper.)
