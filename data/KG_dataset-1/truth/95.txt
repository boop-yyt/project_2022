The radio program is one of the call-up-somebody-and-ask-them-a-question contest shows; the announcer gives the phone number of the man's bedroom phone as the number he's calling, and a male voice answers.  It's been suggested that such shows don't usually give the phone number being called; so instead the wife's name could be given as who's being called, and there could be appropriate background sounds when the other man answers the phone.
