A bunch of people are on an ocean voyage in a yacht.  One afternoon, they all decide to go swimming, so they put on swimsuits and dive off the side into the water.  Unfortunately, they forget to set up a ladder on the side of the boat, so there's no way for them to climb back in, and they drown.The same situation, except that they set out a ladder which is just barely long enough.  When they all dive into the water, the boat, without their weight, rises in the water until the ladder is just barely out of reach.  (also from Steve Jacquot)
