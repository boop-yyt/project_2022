The lighthouse keeper uses his job as an alibi while he's elsewhere committing a crime, but the light goes out and a ship crashes, thereby disproving the alibi.  The lighthouse keeper kills himself when he realizes his alibi is no good.  A man commits a heinous crime, claiming as his alibi that he was onboard a certain ship.  When he learns that (due to a lighthouse failure) the ship was wrecked without reaching port safely, he realizes that his alibi is disproven and commits suicide to avoid being sent to prison.
