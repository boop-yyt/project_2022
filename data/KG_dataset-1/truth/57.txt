The man was struck by an object thrown from the roof of the Empire State Building.  Originally I had the object being a penny, but several people suggested that a penny probably wouldn't be enough to penetrate someone's skull.  Something aerodynamic and heavier, like a dart, was suggested, but I don't know how much mass would be required.
