True story: in France, shortly after the fall of the Bastille, food shortages became a problem again.  A mob of people went to Versaille to petition the king to do something about the problem.  A small delegation was admitted to meet the king.  One woman, overcome with emotion, could only cry "Pain" (French for "bread") and faint. (Source: Durant, _The Age of Napoleon_, pg. 25)  Note that this only works in printed form, not aloud, because the French word is pronounced more like English "pan" than like English "pain."Nine months earlier, this woman had been impregnated by the previous king, who died soon afterword.  Now, she is giving birth to the new king.  (TV)
