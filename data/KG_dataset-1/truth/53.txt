The man is blind.  His first time in the elevator, he's wearing gloves; the elevator uses buttons that work by electrical conduction through the skin; they light up at the slightest touch, but not through a glove.  The man thus has to remove a glove to get the button to work.  But he discovers that first day that as he runs his ungloved hand over the buttons to find the tenth floor, all the buttons are activated, and the elevator stops at all the floors.  So from then on, he carries a glove with him; he puts it on when he enters the elevator, finds the right button with his gloved hand, then uses his ungloved hand to press the tenth-floor button.  (Note that even if the buttons are labeled in Braille, it's hard to avoid brushing against a button and sending the elevator to the wrong floor.)
