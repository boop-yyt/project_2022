A blind swimmer sets an alarm clock to tell him when and what direction to go to shore.  The first bell is a buoy, which he mistakenly swims to, getting tired and drowning.  Then the alarm clock goes off.  In other variations, the first bell is a ship's bell, and/or the second bell is a hand-bell rung by a friend on shore at a pre-arranged time.The man falls off a belltower, pulling the bell-cord (perhaps he was climbing a steeple while hanging onto the rope), and dies. The second bell is one rung at his funeral.  Could also be a variant on #1.75 (as suggested by Mike Neergaard): the bell-cord breaks when he falls (and there's no second bell involved).The man is a boxer.  The first bell signals the start of a round; the second is either the end of the round or a funeral bell after he dies during the match.  Could also be a variant on #1.75 (as suggested by Mike Neergaard): a boxing match in which the top rope breaks, tumbling a boxer to the floor (and he dies of a concussion).
