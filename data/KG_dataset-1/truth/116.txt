The object she throws is a boomerang.  It flies out, loops around, and comes back and hits her in the head, killing her.  Boomerangs do not often return so close to the point from which they were thrown, but I believe it's possible for this to happen.(silly) She's in a submarine or spacecraft and throws a heavy object at the window, which breaks.
