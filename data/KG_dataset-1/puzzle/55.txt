The king dies and two men both claim to be his long-lost son.  One of the king's advisors proposes a test to determine the identity of the true heir.  One claimant agrees to the test; the other refuses.  The one who agreed is sent packing; the one who refused is identified as the rightful heir.  (SP, from _The Next Book of OMNI Games_; earlier from _How Come?_) How could this be?
